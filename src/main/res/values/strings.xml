    <string name="explanation">
        The ODM version check has failed! This means the os is currently using
        a version of the proprietary binaries, which your Android is not build for. This may will work
        without further problems, but could also harm your device.\n
        Please consider upgrading your them as soon as possible. Commonly you could just flash the oem
        partition(s) with them - but for further reference please visit a guide for your device (you
        may press the button below).\n
        When you are the maintainer of this rom you should think about overriding the respective property.
